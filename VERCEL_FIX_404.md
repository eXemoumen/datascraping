# 🔧 Fix Vercel 404 Error

## The Problem

You're getting a 404 error because Vercel needs the correct configuration.

## ✅ Solution - Redeploy with Correct Settings

### Step 1: Check Your Vercel Project Settings

1. Go to your project on Vercel
2. Click **"Settings"**
3. Go to **"General"**

### Step 2: Verify These Settings

**Root Directory:**
```
frontend
```
☝️ This is CRITICAL! Make sure it's set to `frontend`

**Framework Preset:**
```
Next.js
```

**Build Command:**
```
npm run build
```
(Leave as default)

**Output Directory:**
```
.next
```
(Leave as default)

**Install Command:**
```
npm install
```
(Leave as default)

### Step 3: Redeploy

1. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click the **"..."** menu on the latest deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"**
4. Wait 2-3 minutes

## 🎯 Alternative: Deploy from Scratch

If the above doesn't work, delete and recreate:

### 1. Delete Current Project
- Go to Settings → General
- Scroll to bottom
- Click "Delete Project"

### 2. Create New Project
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click **"Add New..."** → **"Project"**
3. Select your GitHub repo
4. **IMPORTANT:** Set **Root Directory** to `frontend`
5. Click **"Deploy"**

## 🔍 Common Issues

### Issue 1: Wrong Root Directory
**Problem:** Root directory is set to `.` or empty
**Fix:** Change to `frontend`

### Issue 2: Build Fails
**Problem:** Dependencies not installing
**Fix:** Check `frontend/package.json` exists

### Issue 3: Environment Variables
**Problem:** API calls failing
**Fix:** Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in Settings → Environment Variables

## 📋 Checklist

Before redeploying, verify:

- [ ] Root Directory = `frontend`
- [ ] Framework = Next.js
- [ ] `frontend/package.json` exists
- [ ] `frontend/app/page.tsx` exists
- [ ] Git repo is up to date

## 🚀 Quick Fix Commands

Run these locally to ensure everything is correct:

cd frontend
npm install
npm run build

# 2. If build succeeds, push to GitHub
cd ..
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel configuration"

# 🔧 Exact Fix for "No Next.js version detected"

## The Problem

Vercel is looking in the wrong directory. Even though you set Root Directory to `frontend`, it's not being applied correctly.

## ✅ Solution - Manual Configuration

### Step 1: Delete Current Project

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**
4. Scroll to the bottom
5. Click **"Delete Project"**
6. Confirm deletion

### Step 2: Create New Project with Correct Settings

1. Go back to Vercel dashboard
2. Click **"Add New..."** → **"Project"**
3. Click **"Import"** on your GitHub repo

### Step 3: CRITICAL - Configure Before Deploying

**On the configuration screen, you'll see:**

```
Configure Project
├── Framework Preset: [Next.js ▼]
├── Root Directory: [Edit ▼]  ← CLICK THIS!
├── Build Command: npm run build
└── Output Directory: .next
```

**Click "Edit" next to Root Directory:**
- A text box will appear
- Type exactly: `frontend`
- Click outside the box to save

**Verify it shows:**
```
Root Directory: frontend
```

### Step 4: Deploy

Click **"Deploy"** button

Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete.

## ✅ Expected Build Log

You should see:
```
✓ Cloning completed
✓ Running "vercel build"
✓ Installing dependencies...
✓ Detected Next.js version: 15.5.5
✓ Building...
✓ Build completed
```

## 🎯 Alternative: Use Vercel CLI (Easier!)

This bypasses the dashboard issues:

```bash
# 1. Go to frontend folder
cd frontend

# 2. Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# 3. Login to Vercel
vercel login

# 4. Deploy
vercel --prod
```

**Answer the prompts:**
- Set up and deploy? **Y**
- Which scope? **Select your account**
- Link to existing project? **N** (create new)
- What's your project's name? **espaceagro-scraper**
- In which directory is your code located? **./** (press Enter)
- Want to override settings? **N**

This will deploy directly from the frontend folder!

## 🔍 Why This Happens

Vercel has a bug where the Root Directory setting doesn't always save properly in the UI. Using the CLI from inside the frontend folder bypasses this issue.

## ✅ After Successful Deploy

You'll get a URL like:
```
https://espaceagro-scraper.vercel.app
```

Visit it and you should see your dashboard!

## Adding New Data Sources

To add a new scraping source:

1. Create a new method in `ExportOpportunityScraper` class
2. Follow the pattern of existing methods
3. Extract contact information using `ContactExtractor`
4. Filter out big companies with `_is_big_company()`
5. Add to the `run()` method

Example:

```python
def scrape_new_source(self):
    """Scrape from new source"""
    logger.info("=== Scraping New Source ===")
    
    # Your scraping logic here
    
    for item in items:
        producer = BioProducer(
            company_name=name,
            phone=phone,
            # ... other fields
            source='New Source'
        )
        self.producers.append(producer)
```

## Adding New Product Types

To add new product categories:

```python
self.target_products = {
    'new_product': ['search', 'terms', 'here'],
}
```
